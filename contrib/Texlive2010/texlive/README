These are patches for kpdf (for qt-3) or okular (for qt-4) that enable
the following additional feature:

   If the PDF being viewed is a prerex-formatted chart (with the
   coordinate grid enabled), clicking in a course box/mini or arrow will
   put the coordinates of the box/mini centre or of the arrow source
   and target boxes into the X clipboard; the coordinates can then
   be "pasted" into a command being composed at the prerex prompt by
   middle-clicking the mouse. Similarly, clicking on any point in the
   background coordinate grid will put the coordinates of that point
   into the X clipboard. The "hand" or "arrow" cursor changes to a
   "crosshair" cursor to signal successful capture of coordinate values
   (until the mouse moves).

Note that this approach is now deprecated; the previewer is a lightweight
application which doesn't have to be re-patched every time the KDE version
changes.

Installation

kpdf/okular is distributed as part of the kdegraphics package. Install
kdegraphics-x.y.z (and the KDE libraries it depends on), where x.y.z
is the version number in the name of the patch file. Also obtain the
sources for the relevant version of kdegraphics, either directly from

ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/stable/

or using the source package for a distribution. Unpack the source and
apply any distributor-supplied patches.

Move to the kdegraphics-x.y.z directory and do

 cp -r kpdf kpdf.orig

or

 cp -r okular okular.orig

Copy the patch file to the kdegraphics directory and do

 patch -p0 < patch-file 

If the patch is successful, do

 ./configure --prefix=/usr

for kde-3 or 

 cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr .

for kde-4. 

If the configuration step is successful, move to the (patched) 
kpdf/okular directory and do

 make 
 make install  (as root)

You do not have to build and re-install all parts of kdegraphics;
the "make" and "make install" will build and over-write just the
kpdf/okular-related portions.
